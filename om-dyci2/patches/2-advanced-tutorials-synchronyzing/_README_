README
--------

These tutorials require the OM-SuperVP library. 

Get them it from https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/om-supervp/. 

Move the superVP lib for instance in om-dyci2/dependencies/ and make sure that the path to this directory is in the search path.

This release includes SuperVP executables for macOS, Windows, Linux. These programs are protected and require an authorization through Ircam forum subscription. 
See: https://www.ircam.fr/product/abonnement-premium-individuel-annuel/ (see *** note below)

Then in OM:
- windows/session window/external libraries then double click on om-supervp to load it
- preferences/libraries, in om-SuperVP :
	- SuperVP exec --> path to supervp exec (for instance dependencies/om-supervp/resources/bin/mac/SuperVP/SuperVP.app/Contents/MacOS/supervp-2.103.2)
	- Authorize --> path of the activation key if needed (for instance dependencies/om-supervp/resources/bin/mac/Ircam_Activation_key.txt)


(***) Free-releases of the library (not including the binaries) are available at: https://github.com/openmusic-project/OM-SuperVP/releases.
You will still need the binaries (and then an Ircam forum subscription): geyt et them from IRCAM ForumNet (https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/analysissynthesis-command-line-tools/) and either put them in OM-SuperVP/resources/bin/{mac,win,linux}/, OR set the path to SuperVP (for instance in .../AudioSculpt/Kernels/) in the OM Preferences/Externals path (visible when the library is loaded).

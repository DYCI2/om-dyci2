SDIF-Tools

The SDIF tools are small applications to extract information from SDIF files or convert the file's contents into a text format.
The standard command-line tools (querysdif, sdifextract, sdiftotext and tosdif) are part of the SDIF source distribution and can be built for a large number of platforms. Pm2Convert and the Droplets are only available in binary MacOSX versions.

Currently only the MacOSX versions are provided as binary executables.

For a full description of the commandline tools' functionality, run them individually with the -h flag.

The droplets sdiftotext and texttosdif are macintosh wrappers around the sdiftotext and tosdif commandline tools, onto which one can drop a file, and a complementary text or sdif file is generated.
